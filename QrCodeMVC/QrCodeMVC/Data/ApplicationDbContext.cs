/*This code is a C# class that inherits from the DbContext class provided by the Entity Framework Core library. It defines an ApplicationDbContext class which will be used to interact with the underlying database.

The ApplicationDbContext class contains two public properties, QRCodes and Barcodes, which are of type DbSet<T>. These properties represent the tables in the database for the corresponding QRCode and Barcode models. The DbSet class is a collection of entities that can be used to query and manipulate data in the database.

The constructor for the ApplicationDbContext class accepts an instance of DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> as a parameter. This is a configuration object that provides options to configure the behavior of the database context, such as specifying the connection string for the database.

Overall, this code provides a framework for accessing and manipulating data in a MySQL database using Entity Framework Core, and defines the mapping between the data models (QRCode and Barcode) and the underlying database tables.  */

To run the C# code as an executable, you need to compile the code into an executable file first. Here are the steps to do that:


Open Visual Studio or any other C# compiler and create a new project using the template of your choice (console application or class library).



Copy the code snippet I provided earlier and paste it into your project.



Make sure to add the required namespaces and dependencies at the top of your code file. You will need to add

using System.Collections.Generic, 
using System.IO, and 
using HtmlAgilityPack; to the top of your file.



If you are using a console application template, replace the default

Main method with the code snippet I provided earlier. If you are using a class library template, you can create a new method in your class and paste the code snippet inside that method.



Build your project by clicking on the "Build" menu and selecting "Build Solution" or by pressing the "Ctrl + Shift + B" keyboard shortcut.



Once the build process is complete, navigate to the "bin" directory of your project in File Explorer. This is where the compiled executable file will be located.



Double-click on the executable file to run it. If you are using a console application, the program will open in the command-line interface. If you are using a class library, you
 will need to call the method containing the code snippet from another program or component.
